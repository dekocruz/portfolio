# Building a Data Transformation Pipeline in PySpark

In this post, I'll walk you through how to create a data transformation pipeline in PySpark, which is a powerful tool for handling large-scale data processing. We'll explore a simple example that filters, categorizes, and aggregates data, and I'll explain each step in detail so you can understand how to apply these techniques to your own projects.

## 1. Setting Up Your PySpark Environment

Before we begin, you need to ensure that your environment is set up to run PySpark. If you haven't installed PySpark yet, you can do so by following the [official installation guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/index.html).

Once PySpark is installed, you can start by creating a Spark session. The Spark session is the entry point to any PySpark functionality, and it is required to create DataFrames, which are the core data structures in PySpark.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
